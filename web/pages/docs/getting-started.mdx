# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up KlyntosGuard and scanning your first file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- A KlyntosGuard account

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Visit [guard.klyntos.com](https://guard.klyntos.com)
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Choose your plan:
   - **Guard Basic** ($29/month) - 1,000 scans/month
   - **Guard Pro** ($99/month) - Unlimited scans + advanced features

## Step 2: Generate an API Key

1. Log in to your dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **CLI**
3. Click "Generate New API Key"
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "My MacBook")
5. **Copy the key immediately** - it won't be shown again!

Your API key will look like this:
```
kg_a1b2c3d4e5f6789...
```

## Step 3: Install the CLI

Install KlyntosGuard globally using pip:

```bash
pip install klyntos-guard
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
kg --version
```

## Step 4: Authenticate

Log in with your API key:

```bash
kg auth login --api-key kg_a1b2c3d4e5f6789...
```

You should see:
```
✓ Successfully logged in as user@example.com
Token saved to ~/.klyntos_guard/auth.json
```

Check your auth status:

```bash
kg auth status
```

## Step 5: Scan Your First File

Create a test file with a vulnerability:

```python
# test.py
API_KEY = "sk-1234567890"  # Hardcoded secret!
password = "admin123"      # Another secret!

def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # SQL injection!
    return query
```

Now scan it:

```bash
kg scan test.py
```

You'll see output like:

```
🔍 Scanning test.py...

🔴 CRITICAL (Line 2)
   Hardcoded API key detected
   💡 Fix: Move to environment variables

🔴 CRITICAL (Line 3)
   Hardcoded password detected
   💡 Fix: Use secure password management

🟠 HIGH (Line 6)
   SQL injection vulnerability
   💡 Fix: Use parameterized queries

✓ Scan complete: 3 issues found in 2.3s
```

## Environment Variables

For easier setup, add these to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# KlyntosGuard Configuration
export KLYNTOS_GUARD_API="https://guard.klyntos.com/api"

# Optional: Set custom config directory
export KLYNTOS_GUARD_CONFIG_DIR="$HOME/.klyntos_guard"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: kg"

Make sure pip's bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin"

# Or use python -m
python -m klyntos_guard auth login
```

### "Unauthorized" error

Your API key may have expired or been revoked. Generate a new one from the dashboard.

### Can't connect to API

Check your internet connection and verify the API URL:

```bash
echo $KLYNTOS_GUARD_API
# Should show: https://guard.klyntos.com/api
```
